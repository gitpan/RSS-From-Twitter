 TODO

To see all options:

 % get-rss-from-twitter --help

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In June 2013, Twitter retired the RSS v1 API (e.g.
http://search.twitter.com/search.rss?q=blah, etc). However, its replacement, the
v1.1 API, is not as straightforward to use (e.g. needs auth). This function
scrapes the Twitter search result page (e.g. https://twitter.com/search?q=blah)
and converts it to RSS. I wrote this because I have other scripts expecting RSS
input.

Expect breakage from time to time though, as scraping method is rather fragile.
